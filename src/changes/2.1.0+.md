## Changes in 2.1.6

Released 2018-12-10.

Downloads are now split into a standard and alternate version.

**The standard version**:

- Is built with the latest toolkit, which fixes various issues.

- Changes the undo shortcut back to Ctrl+Z or Command+Z like Anki 2.0.

- Includes a separate anki-console.exe executable in the Windows build
  that may be useful for add-on authors.

- Includes support for the fcitx input method and a gtk2 theme in the
  Linux build.

You can switch between the standard and alternate 2.1.6 without
problems. If you move back to a previous Anki 2.1 release, your sync
login details and window positions will be lost, and will need to be set
again.

**The standard version has updated requirements**:

- The Windows build only supports 64 bit Windows 7 or later, and will
  not run on a 32 bit install.

- The Mac build requires macOS 10.12 or later.

- The Linux build requires a Linux distribution from approximately
  2016 or later.

The alternate version is similar to previous Anki 2.1 releases, and is
built with an older toolkit. It will run on some older systems that the
standard version will not, but as it is not as up to date, it may be
missing bugfixes and security improvements that the standard version
includes.

**The alternate version will run on**:

- Windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit installs

- Mac 10.10 or later.

- A Linux distro from around 2014 or later.

**In addition to the toolkit upgrade, there have been some changes in
Anki itself**:

- Improvements to the Browse screen and flagging:

  - Search text is normalized, which fixes problems searching for
    unicode characters with multiple possible encodings.

  - The selection is now partially transparent, allowing you to see
    the underyling colours of the rows.

  - The screen doesn’t scroll when performing actions that don’t
    change the selection count.

  - Flags now toggle on and off, and the separate clear flag action
    has been removed.

  - The second flag is now orange instead of purple.

  - Find&replace now only shows fields relevant to the notes you’ve
    selected, and is case insensitive.

  - Fix card list not updating when editing HTML.

  handled.

  missing a parent deck.

  configured for localhost connections.

  bold text.

  similar names could be removed as well.
