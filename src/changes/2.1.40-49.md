## Changes in 2.1.45

A [release candidate](https://betas.ankiweb.net) is available.

Undo handling:

- Most actions now support multiple undo steps. You can change a card template,
  delete some notes, bury a card, then undo each of those steps if you wish.
- Actions that support multiple undo steps will now save the changes
  immediately, meaning that if Anki crashes, the changes you made in the last
  few minutes will no longer be lost.
- Most undoable actions can now be redone, so you can undo an accidental undo.
- Actions that don't support the new undo handling (eg, Check Database), will
  clear the undo history.
- Add-ons will clear the undo history if they modify the database directly, or
  use routines that don't support undoing. There are some new routines available
  to add-ons to make operations undoable, but add-ons may need to be updated
  to use them.

Scheduling changes:

- A new scheduler is available, with a number of improvements. Please see the
  [2021 scheduler page](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html) for
  more information.
- The deck list now shows the learning count separately.
- On new collections, the v2 scheduler is now the default.

Browser changes, mostly thanks to Rumo:

- The sidebar now has two modes. The default allows clicking on items to search
  for them. The other mode allows you to select multiple items at once, so you
  can drag & drop or delete multiple items.
- The browse screen can now be toggled between showing cards,
  and showing notes.
- When showing notes, some columns will show an aggregate over all the
  cards of a note.
- Added an introduced:x search to locate cards first studied in the last x days.
- Column rendering has been moved into the backend, and will be faster than
  before (but is still limited by the speed of the graphics toolkit).
- A fair bit of the browser code has been changed, and some add-ons like the
  "Advanced Browser" add-on will need to be updated to support the new approach.
- New tag icons and associated backend work (thanks to Henrik).
- Added an option in the Preferences screen to customize the starting
  search text (eg, to start with "deck:current").
- More reliably scroll to the current card.
- When opening the Browse screen with an active study card, the whole
  deck is now shown.
- Added 3 new flag colours.
- Flags can now be renamed in the sidebar.
- Horizontal scrolling in the browse screen is less jumpy.
- Sidebar items can be dragged onto the Saved Searches area to add them as a favourite.

Editor changes, mostly thanks to Henrik:

- A new editor toolbar implementation, with improved icons and handling.
- The editor now provides bullet and numbered list buttons.
- The editor now provides buttons to control text alignment and indent.
- Sticky fields can now be toggled on/off from the editing screen.
- A new API is available for add-ons, and the existing API should continue
  to work.
- The HTML editor is now shown inline, and supports syntax highlighting,
  and showing opening/closing tags.
- Warn user when they attempt to use cloze markers inappropriately
  (thanks to Rumo).

State handling:

- When you make changes, the user interface should update more consistently now.
  Adding a new tag to a note will update the sidebar in the Browse screen for
  example, and when you review a card that is shown there, the columns will
  update.
- The Browse screen no longer refreshes a search automatically. When you make a
  change, the column text may update, but the number of rows will not change.
  Deleted cards show "(deleted)" until you search again.
- The main window no longer shows a "waiting for editing to finish" screen. When
  you make changes such as editing a note, the main window will dim, and will
  automatically refresh when you return to it.

The deck options screen has been reimplemented:

- (Re)learning steps are now shown with units, eg 10m or 4d.
- Deck options are now shown on one scrollable page.
- Extra help is available for most options.
- It is easy to see at a glance which options have been changed from the
  default, and individual options can be reverted to the default setting.
- Warnings will be shown for some common issues (eg, review limit too low
  compared to new cards).
- Some of the more advanced options have been moved to a separate "Advanced"
  section.
- The old options can be accessed with a Shift+click, since it will take a while
  for add-ons to be updated to support the new screen. A new API is available,
  thanks to Henrik.
- The deck description is now accessible via a button in the overview screen,
  instead of via the deck options.

Other features:

- An updated Change Notetype implementation, that can match fields by name, and
  allows you to map a source field to multiple destination fields in order to
  clone a field.
- Pre-load images on answer side (thanks to Hikaru).
- The `[...]` in cloze deletions is now read as "blank" by TTS (thanks to Rumo).
- The Find&Replace option in the Browse screen can now be used on tags as well.
- Added a Card Info option to the review screen.
- When opening deck option from the study screen, you'll now be asked which deck
  you want if the card is in a subdeck.
- You can now choose which add-ons you want to update (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
- Support system SSL certs on Linux.
- Extra checks are now done when updating a card template, such as detecting when
  a cloze notetype is missing a cloze directive, or two templates have identical question sides (thanks to Rumo).
- Support Ctrl+Numpad Enter to add cards.
- Added night mode styling to 'type in the answer' box, and improve legibility
  of comparison.
- Sidebar search now scrolls to first match (thanks to Abdo & Rumo).

Fixes:

- Fixed text with single quote not being escaped in export (thanks to Ryan).
- Fixed various links to the manual (thanks to cherryblossom000).
- Force x11 mode when the packaged build is run on a system that tells Qt to use
  Wayland, as Wayland is not currently supported by the packaged build.

Browser improvements:

- Tags now show in a tree (thanks to Abdo).

  decks, manage notetypes, and rename/remove saved searches (thanks to Abdo

- Click on Tags to show all non-empty tags.

Editing improvements:

  MathJax (thanks to Henrik).
- The tags field in the editor now autocompletes from anywhere in a tag name,
  not only the start.
- Invalid field content can no longer spill out into the editing area (thanks to Henrik).

Search improvements:

- Searches are now rewritten into a canonical format (eg `one two` becomes
  `"one" AND "two"`) (thanks to Rumo).
- Search error messages are now much more specific (thanks to Rumo).
- is:learn, is:due and prop:due now handle more cases, such as suspended cards
  (thanks to Henrik).
- Added prop:pos search to search for new card position (thanks to Abdo).
- Added a shortcut to replace part of a search with a different search
  (eg changing the selected deck) (thanks to Rumo).
- Support resched:x for searching for cards that were manually rescheduled
  in x days (thanks to Henrik).

  displayed by the graph (thanks to Henrik).

  (thanks to Henrik).
- Place less emphasis on outliers in the Calendar graph (thanks to Henrik).
- Ignore manually scheduled cards in hour graph.

Scheduler improvements:

- The V2 scheduler no longer applies parent review limits to child decks.
  Previously the limits were inconsistently applied, which could lead to the
  deck list not reflecting the actual number of cards you'd receive when you
  clicked on a deck. AnkiMobile and AnkiWeb have been updated to match this
  behaviour, and AnkiDroid will also be updated soon. Using 2.1.41 in
  conjunction with older clients will not cause any problems when syncing, but
  you may find the deck list/review counts do not match.
- The V1->V2 upgrade process no longer resets cards that are in learning, or
  removes cards from filtered decks.
- Users on the old scheduler will now see a message at the top of the deck
  list prompting them to update to the Anki 2.1 scheduler.
- There is no option to downgrade to the V1 scheduler anymore, though you can
  still do so by downgrading to an older Anki version first.

Reworked the Reschedule tool:

- Split into separate "Forget" and "Set Due Date" actions
- "Set Due Date" defaults to not adjusting the card interval.
- Changed the "Delete Tags" shortcut; Ctrl+Shift+D now changes the due date.
- Added the action to the review screen as well.
- Input now remembered.

Other changes:

- A basic sync server is now built into Anki. It does not yet support
  media. Docs are in the docs/ folder of the source tree.
- The title bar on Macs will now turn dark when night mode is activated.
- Deck descriptions of the congratulations screen can be enabled by turning markdown
  on in the deck options, but only 2.1.41+ will be able to render the markdown.
- Add opus to media list in editor.
- Edit/More buttons auto-hide when window is small (thanks to Henrik).
- Support Alt+number to switch between clozes in the card layout screen (thanks to Abdo).
- Use monospace font in HTML editor.
- Improve error message when trying to nest under a filtered deck (thanks to Rumo).
- Reposition dialog's "shift cards" option now defaults to off.
- Other fixes and improvements thanks to Henrik, Rumo, Abdo, Arthur, Maksim, Guillem,
  stayingpeachy, Daniel, khonkhortisan and Kerrick.
