Released 2020-12-12, build 6d596c8f.

## Changes in 2.1.36

Released 2020-12-09, build c505894b.

Notable changes:

- Alternate builds have been discontinued. If you are using a 32 bit system, or
  a macOS version older than 10.13, Anki 2.1.35 is the last release you will be able
  to update to.
- MathJax has been updated to version 3, thanks to Henrik. It should render faster
  than before. If you were customizing the MathJax configuration using Javascript,
  you will need to
  [use a new method](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/809#issuecomment-721438738).
- A separate mpv process is now used to play videos on Windows, which should
  solve issues with playing getting stuck, thanks to Kelciour.
- The handling of wildcards and escape characters in search [has been
  reworked](https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html#matching-special-characters)
  to be more consistent, thanks to Rumo.
- Early startup messages are now translable, thanks to Abdo.
- When cards are rescheduled in the browse screen, a review entry log is now created.
- The main card area is now focused instead of the bottom area during review,
  which allows using the keyboard to scroll, thanks to Henrik.

Bugfixes:

- Fixed corrupt indexes when checking database.
- Fixed duplicate search when sort field is not first field (thanks to Abdo).
- Fixed error when switching to note type with fewer fields.
- Fixed invalid utf8 in notes when checking database.
- Fixed invisible scrollbar in night mode + browser.
- Fixed issues with "find duplicates" (thanks to Abdo)
- Fixed some issues with adding/renaming decks (thanks to Cecini).
- Other minor fixes.

For developers:

- Anki is now built using Bazel. This leads to more reliable builds, and reduces
  the number of dependencies you need to manually install. Please see docs/ for
  updated build instructions, and report any issues you encounter on the user
  forums.
- The minimum Python version has been updated to 3.8.
- The wheels available on PyPI support both Python 3.8 and 3.9.
- All translations have been migrated to [Fluent](https://translating.ankiweb.net/anki/developers.html).
- Normal and night mode theming now uses CSS variables, making it easier to override in add-ons.
- The congrats screen, burying/suspending, filtered deck building/emptying, browser sidebar, and card
  reposition/reset have been reworked. If you were modifying them in an add-on, your add-on
  may need updating. For the congratulations screen, see the new webview_did_inject_style_into_page
  hook

Thanks to all the people who have contributed bugfixes and code/doc updates:
Abdo, Lukkea, Akshara, Kelciour, David, Henrik, Colin, Johan, Piotr, Andreas,
Arthur, Alan, RumovZ, Cecini, Soren, Krish, ianki, Cyphar and kaczmarj, in no

## Changes in 2.1.35

Released 2020-10-02, build 84dcaa86.

- Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.29+ that caused excessive memory and CPU usage
  on long-running operations that show a progress bar, such as importing.
- Roll back Mac and Windows builds to Qt 5.14 again,
  as there are still issues with 5.15.

- Fix preview not updating on multiple selection (thanks to abdo).
- Fix old content appearing when flagging immediately
  after typing.

## Changes in 2.1.34

Released 2020-09-24, build 8af8f565.

- Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to
  an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck
  configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those
  deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. Users who updated from
  an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not be
  affected. If you have deliberately set an initial ease of 130%, please change
  it to 131% or greater prior to upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings
  alone. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.
- Update the standard builds to the latest GUI toolkit version.
  Please report any improvements or regressions you notice.
- Dropped audio plays automatically again (thanks to abdo).
- Revert to older sound playing behaviour to work around issues
  (thanks to kelciour).
- is:due now stops at now+learn ahead limit, instead of end of day.
- Various improvements/fixes, some thanks Aleksa & Henrik.
