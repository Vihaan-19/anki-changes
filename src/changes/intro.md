âš  After using the latest version, if you wish to open your collection with an
earlier Anki release, please go to the File>Switch Profile menu item, and click
on "Downgrade & Quit". If you skip this step, you may get an error message when
opening your collection in an older Anki version, and you will need to return to
this version, downgrade, then try again.
