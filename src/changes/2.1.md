## Translations

- [日本語](http://rs.luminousspice.com/changeinanki2/)

## At a glance

- Anki 2.1 uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki
  2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.

- It’s built with recent support libraries (Python 3.6, Qt 5.9/5.12),
  bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution
  displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.

- It requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux
  distro from around 2014+.

- Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.

## Add-ons

Add-ons need to be updated to work with Anki 2.1. [Some
add-ons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1) have already been
updated; others have not been ported yet.

When you install 2.1, it will create a separate folder for add-ons, and
not import any existing ones you have installed.

If you’re an add-on author, you can read more about the required changes
on <https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html>

## Other changes

Anki 2.1 brings numerous bugfixes, and some quality of life
improvements, such as:

- Built in MathJax support

- A "restore backup" option in the profiles screen

- SVG rendering support for LaTeX

- Improved add-on configuration, management and updating

- Night mode for reviewing

- Improved pasting, with less unnecessary formatting included, and
  better handling of media links. You can hold the shift key when
  pasting to allow more formatting to be included.

The Browse screen has been simplified:

- Various shortcuts that were previously in the sidebar are now
  available via the Filter button. If you find yourself frequently
  accessing certain items, you can save the search to have them appear
  in the side bar.

- The top bar with common shortcuts has been removed. You can access
  all actions quickly by right clicking or ctrl+clicking in the card
  list instead, and there is an add-on available for adding back the
  top bar if you still prefer it.

A full list of changes made during the alpha and beta period are
documented [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/beta.html).

## Experimental scheduler

Anki 2.1 contains an optional, [experimental
scheduler](https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/experiment-scheduling-changes-in-anki-21).
The experimental scheduler is not compatible with older Anki versions.
