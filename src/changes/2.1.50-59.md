## Changes in 2.1.53

Released 2022-05-28.

### Editor Improvements

- Rework image resizing (thanks to Henrik). Images expand to the editor width by default now,
  and images that are resized for the editor will remain that way if you switch fields, or
  navigate to a different note and back.

## Changes in 2.1.52

Released 2022-05-13.

### Editor Improvements

- Ctrl/Cmd+A in tag editing area now selects all tags (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).
- Fixed backspace sometimes removing multiple images at once (thanks to Henrik).
- Fixed copying and pasting MathJax on Windows (Qt6).
- Fixed handling of `<` and `>` symbols in MathJax (thanks to Henrik).
- Fixed intermittent editor loading failures when add-ons have injected a large amount of code.
- Fixed pasting of local files of unsupported types that contain spaces (thanks to Abdo).
- Fixed some formatting being lost when copying between fields on Windows (Qt6).
- Fixed various issues with tag editing (thanks to BlueGreenMagick and Henrik).
- Pressing tab on the last field now moves focus to tag area (thanks to Henrik).
- Reduce size of editor buttons on Windows/Linux (thanks to Henrik).
- Tags copied from the tag editor are no longer joined together when pasted into the add tags/remove tags dialogs (thanks to Henrik).

- Lists on cards are now aligned to the left by default (thanks to Matthias).
- Removed the highlight on the Show Answer and Good buttons.
- Reset page zoom when moving between different screens.
- The Qt6 Linux build now defaults to X11/XWayland instead of Wayland due to some [remaining issues](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/issues/1767); you can force-enable Wayland with ANKI_WAYLAND=1.

### For Developers

- The `field_filter` hook can now check if it's running for the question or answer side (thanks to Abdo).
- Added a `av_player_will_play_tags` hook (thanks to Abdo).
- Make it easier to search in fields programmatically (thanks to Abdo).

### New Apkg Import/Export

This build also includes a new implementation of apkg importing and exporting, thanks to Rumo. Some advantages:

- Undo/redo is now supported.
- Faster imports (especially for decks with a lot of note content).
- Support for older clients can be optionally disabled, which results in smaller
  apkg files, and faster imports.
- Flags are removed when scheduling is excluded.

The new functionality is hidden behind a feature flag, and **not active by default**.
You can try it out by using `mw.pm.set_new_import_export(True)` in the [debug console](https://docs.ankiweb.net/misc.html#debug-console).
To revert to the old behaviour, replace True with False.

Things to note:

- This is new code that has received limited testing so far, so please use `File>Create Backup` before trying it out.
  Any testing/feedback you can provide would be appreciated.
- While active, it is not currently possible to import/export files other than apkg/colpkg.
- The Special Fields add-on will not work while this functionality is enabled.

## Changes in 2.1.51

- Improve editor startup time, especially with many fields (thanks to Henrik).

Fixes:

- Fixed compatibility with older macOS versions.
- Fixed an issue that was breaking some add-ons when running on Windows without using anki-console.bat
- Anki now closes the Browse screen before full sync or colpkg import/export, so it doesn't show errors.
- Automatically re-enable disabled add-ons when user explicitly reinstalls them, and improve conflict handling (thanks to Aristotelis).
- Fixed an issue with the search history when clicking on items in the sidebar (thanks to Rumo).
- Fixed card layout screen opening too wide if card template name was long (thanks to Sam).
- Fixed compatibility with 'card info during review' and similar add-ons.

## Changes in 2.1.50

Released 2022-04-09.

### Platform-Specific Changes

Windows:

- Windows 10 or 11 is required. If you are still using Windows 7 or 8, 2.1.49 is
  the last build that will install on your system.

macOS:

- Anki now supports Apple Silicon natively. If you're on a newer Mac with an M1
  processor, pick the qt6-apple download for better performance and battery
  life.
- The Qt6 x86 build requires macOS 10.14.4
- The Qt5 x86 build requires macOS 10.13.4.

Linux:

- The Linux builds need zstd to decompress, eg:

```sh
sudo apt install zstd
tar xaf anki-2.1.50-linux-qt6.tar.zstd
```

- The packaged version requires glibc 2.28 or later.
- A wheel is now provided for ARM64 Linux, and requires glibc 2.31 or greater. See
  [this page](https://betas.ankiweb.net/#via-pypipip) for instructions on using it.
- Both Fcitx4 and Fcitx5 support is now bundled.

### Qt6

Please see the notes for your platform:

- [Windows](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/windows/installing.html#qt5-vs-qt6)
- [Mac](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/mac/installing.html#qt5-vs-qt6)
- [Linux](https://docs.ankiweb.net/platform/linux/installing.html#qt5-vs-qt6)

### Scheduler Changes

The V1 scheduler is no longer supported. If you have not yet updated to V2 or
V3, you will be prompted to update when you attempt to review cards in 2.1.50.

This release includes a number of improvements to the V3 scheduler, mostly
thanks to Rumo:

- Intermediate deck limits now affect their children. Please see the [scheduler
  page](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits) for more
  info.
- When new cards are answered, Anki now records their original position. When you later
  export a shared deck without scheduling, the original positions will be restored.
- The Forget action now gives you options to restore the original card position,
  and to reset the card's lapse and repetition counters.
- The gathering and sorting of new cards has been reworked, trading a little performance
  for more intuitive behaviour:
  - It is now possible to sort notes or cards randomly at gather time, ensuring a random
    selection is taken from all available new cards.
  - The gather order and sort order options have been simplified, but should offer the same
    functionality as before. Please check your deck options after upgrading, as some users
    may need to adjust their display order settings to match what they were using before.
- The overview screen now shows how many cards will be buried.
- Added a separate option to control burying of interday learning siblings.
- Fixed interday learning siblings not being buried during review, causing them
  to reappear later after actions like an edit.
- If you have more than 2 learning steps, after the first step, Hard repeats the previous
  delay, instead of being the average of the previous and next step.
- When a Hard learning step exceeds a day, it is now rounded to a full day, so the
  delay does not vary depending on the time of day you answer.
- Fuzz is applied more evenly now, especially with smaller intervals.
- Fixed new cards not decrementing the review limit, which could lead to
  more new cards appearing after the review limit was reached.
- Review cards and new cards are now interspersed more evenly.
- When using Custom Study to extend deck limits in the V3 scheduler, parent/child
  limits of the selected deck are no longer adjusted.

### Editor Changes

Most of these changes are thanks to Henrik.

- A redesigned editing area, and a redesigned tag editor.
- MathJax has a live preview.
- HTML source and rendered text can be viewed at the same time.
- The HTML editor now matches the current Anki theme.
- Images can be resized within the editor.
- Fields can now have an optional description/tooltip assigned to them (thanks
  to Matthias, Henrik & Rumo).
- The "remove formatting" button now offers a choice of what to remove.
- Adjust color picker shortcut, and apply color when different color selected.
- Reduced editor button size on Windows/Linux (thanks to Matthias).
- Fixed IME input after pressing tab.
- Fixed media files not being inserted at cursor position on Windows.
- Cloze shortcut correctly positions cursor.
- Added a separate cloze button to repeat the current cloze.
- Lots of behind-the-scenes changes and fixes. Because of the extensive changes,
  some add-ons that modify the editing screen will have broken (see the
  developers section below)

### New Features

- Anki will now switch to day or night mode automatically depending on your
  system settings. You can force day or night mode in the Preferences screen.
  (thanks in large part to Rumo).
- Reworked backup handling (mostly thanks to Rumo):
  - Backups are created much faster than they were previously.
  - Anki can now create backups periodically. The default is every 30 minutes; you can adjust this in the preferences screen.
  - There are new options in the preferences to control the number of daily, weekly and
    monthly backups you'd like to retain.
  - The File menu now has an option to create a backup immediately.
  - Because the backup storage format has changed, backups created with 2.1.50 will not be
    importable into older Anki versions.
- Reworked .colpkg import/export (thanks to Rumo):
  - When exporting, you can optionally target Anki 2.1.50+. When doing so,
    imports and exports are faster, and media files will be compressed, but the
    resulting .colpkg will not be readable by older Anki clients.
  - Collections are now checked for corruption when importing.
- An option to ignore accents in searches by default has been added to
  preferences screen (thanks to Abdo).
- The Card Info screen now updates automatically as you change to a different
  card (thanks to Rumo).
- Added a View menu to the main window and browse window (thanks to Rumo). The
  view menu provides options to zoom in and out, and to toggle a full screen
  mode. Due to technical issues, the full screen mode is not currently available
  on Windows when graphics acceleration is enabled.
- A new TTS tag format that allows you to combine extra text and multiple
  fields, such as `[anki:tts lang=en_US]Here is {{Field1}} and {{Field2}}[/anki:tts]` (thanks to Rumo). There are no plans to deprecate the
  old TTS syntax - either can be used.
- Added an option to add/remove sidebar tag to selected notes (thanks to Rumo).
- Be smarter about mapping existing text to new fields when switching notetypes in the Add screen (thanks to Abdo).
- Apkg files can now be dragged on the main window to import them (thanks to Abdo).
- Added a "Create Copy" option in the browse screen and review screen, to copy
  selected note's contents into the Add window (thanks to Rumo).
- You can now search for tags by regular expression (thanks to Rumo). One use
  for this is locating notes that are tagged with a `parent` tag, while not matching
  ones tagged with `parent::child`: `tag:re:^parent$`.
- When switching Anki versions, an add-on update check is run on startup (thanks to Rumo).
- Make links with `target=_blank` work (thanks to Danish).
- Added "Forget Card" action to review screen (thanks to Araceli).
- Added Belarusian and Odia to available languages in the preferences.
- Added a silent option (/s) for the Windows uninstaller (thanks to Patric).
- Added tooltips to some browser columns (thanks to Rumo).

### Other Improvements

### For Developers

- Anki now requires Python 3.9.
- Anki contains some compatibility shims that should allow many add-ons written
  for PyQt5 to work with PyQt6 as well (thanks to Aristotelis). These shims will
  not remain forever, so it is recommended that you update your add-ons to be
  compatible with Qt6 without shims. The two main breakages are the renaming of
  PyQt5 to PyQt6 (you can support both by importing from aqt.qt instead), and
  the requirement that [enums are
  qualified](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/1406/commits/a7812dedc096627692ab3d7e64b90be632f52134).
- If you’re using Qt Designer to generate UI files, the Qt5 and Qt6 versions
  need to be generated and bundled separately if you want to support both at once.
- PyQt6 does not support the Qt resource system (pyrcc was removed), so Anki now
  uses a different approach, and urls like `:/icons/foo.jpg` should become
  `icons:foo.jpg`.
- Henrik has spent a lot of time working out how to smoothly provide an API for
  the editor, and investigating how we can provide types to make targeting the API
  easier. This has required a number of refactorings, and some add-ons that were
  accessing the editor will have broken in this update. While the code is
  not set in stone yet, hopefully we're getting there. An example of using the
  latest API is available here: <https://github.com/hgiesel/anki_new_format_pack/commits/master>
- The way Anki is packaged has changed. Most of the standard library should be
  available now. If you notice any problems importing standard libraries that
  previously worked, please let us know.
- The aqt package no longer depends on PyQt, as either version 5 or 6 is supported.
  You can specify the major version you want when installing - eg `pip install 'aqt[qt6]'`
- manifest.json now supports a 'homepage' argument (thanks to Abdo)
- `mw.progress.timer()` should now be passed a `parent` argument, as the
  previous default of using `mw` prevents the timers from being freed after they
  are no longer active. If you want a permanent timer, pass `mw` in as the parent.
- Improved Python code completion/type handling in VS Code (thanks to Rumo).
