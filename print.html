<h2 id="changes-in-2147"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2147">Changes in 2.1.47</a></h2>
<p>Released 2021-08-29.</p>
<p>Changes to the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">v3 scheduler</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interday learning cards are included in the learning count again, instead of
the review count.</li>
<li>Interday learning cards are still affected by the review limit. Interday
learning cards are fetched first, then reviews, and finally new cards.</li>

appear in your graphs.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where an error message could appear after undoing/redoing a mix
of reviews and other changes.</li>
<li>Fixed custom scheduling not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;timebox finished&quot; message is now shown on card answer, instead of after
revealing the next card. This should also address an issue where the message
popped up outside of review.</li>
<li>Added shortcut for Forget in the Browse screen.</li>
<li>Fixed an error being shown when there was no current deck.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect quoting in duplicate search (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Fixed deck options inverting the &quot;replay question when showing answer&quot; option.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with ampersands in the Add Cards history button (thanks to
Arthur).</li>
<li>Fixed handling of audio/video tags (thanks to Hikaru).</li>
<li>Fixed errors playing audio when computer was slow to respond (thanks to Kelciour).</li>
<li>Fixed preferences screen not updating undo menu, and causing an error when
subsequently reviewing a card in the v3 scheduler.</li>
<li>Fixed case changes being ignored in tag rename.</li>
<li>Fixed error shown when DB check run on corrupt collection.</li>
<li>Fixed deck options prompt showing the default deck, instead of the correct one.</li>
<li>Fixed reposition command ignoring suspended cards.</li>
<li>Fixed answer button highlight on Windows (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Fixed calendar graph day labels showing incorrectly in some timezones.</li>
<li>Improved validation of add-on package names (thanks to BlueGreenMagick for the
report and initial fix).</li>
</ul>
<p>For add-on developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Svelte components Anki exports should now work correctly in add-ons,
provided they exclude Svelte when bundling.</li>
<li>WithShortcut is now also available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-2146"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2146">Changes in 2.1.46</a></h2>
<p>Released 2021-08-04.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix duplicate text when pasting with Ctrl+Shift+V (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Remember last colors in editing window (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Show flag and mark icons in preview window (thanks to Hikaru).</li>
<li>Center first match when searching in sidebar (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Added F9/Shift+F9 shortcuts for sticky fields, and increase opacity (thanks to
Henrik).</li>
<li>Fixed starting ease specified in deck options not being used by v3 scheduler.</li>
<li>Fixed learning cutoff not updating during review, and some learning cards
remaining at the end of review in the v3 scheduler.</li>
<li>Fixed Change Notetype not mapping fields correctly when count differed.</li>
<li>The congrats screen now updates periodically again.</li>
<li>Fixed Redo menu item showing Undo action name.</li>
<li>Fixed notetype selection in the import screen.</li>
<li>Fixed error in overview/congrats screen when there is no current deck.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-2145"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2145">Changes in 2.1.45</a></h2>
<p>Released 2021-07-30.</p>
<p>Undo handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most actions now support multiple undo steps. You can change a card template,
delete some notes, bury a card, then undo each of those steps if you wish.</li>
<li>Actions that support multiple undo steps will now save the changes
immediately, meaning that if Anki crashes, the changes you made in the last
few minutes will no longer be lost.</li>
<li>Most undoable actions can now be redone, so you can undo an accidental undo.</li>
<li>Actions that don't support the new undo handling (eg, Check Database), will
clear the undo history.</li>
<li>Add-ons will clear the undo history if they modify the database directly, or
use routines that don't support undoing. There are some new routines available
to add-ons to make operations undoable, but add-ons may need to be updated
to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduling changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new scheduler is available, with a number of improvements. Please see the
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">2021 scheduler page</a> for
more information.</li>
<li>The deck list now shows the learning count separately.</li>
<li>On new collections, the v2 scheduler is now the default.</li>
<li>Set due date uses the deck's configured starting ease (thanks to cyphar).</li>
</ul>
<p>Browser changes, mostly thanks to Rumo:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sidebar now has two modes. The default allows clicking on items to search
for them. The other mode allows you to select multiple items at once, so you
can drag &amp; drop or delete multiple items.</li>
<li>The browse screen can now be toggled between showing cards,
and showing notes.</li>
<li>When showing notes, some columns will show an aggregate over all the
cards of a note.</li>
<li>Added an introduced:x search to locate cards first studied in the last x days.</li>
<li>Column rendering has been moved into the backend, and will be faster than
before (but is still limited by the speed of the graphics toolkit).</li>
<li>A fair bit of the browser code has been changed, and some add-ons like the
&quot;Advanced Browser&quot; add-on will need to be updated to support the new approach.</li>
<li>New tag icons and associated backend work (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Added an option in the Preferences screen to customize the starting
search text (eg, to start with &quot;deck:current&quot;).</li>
<li>More reliably scroll to the current card.</li>
<li>When opening the Browse screen with an active study card, the whole
deck is now shown.</li>
<li>Added 3 new flag colours.</li>
<li>Flags can now be renamed in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Horizontal scrolling in the browse screen is less jumpy.</li>
<li>Sidebar items can be dragged onto the Saved Searches area to add them as a favourite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Editor changes, mostly thanks to Henrik:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new editor toolbar implementation, with improved icons and handling.</li>
<li>The editor now provides bullet and numbered list buttons.</li>
<li>The editor now provides buttons to control text alignment and indent.</li>
<li>Sticky fields can now be toggled on/off from the editing screen.</li>
<li>A new API is available for add-ons, and the existing API should continue
to work.</li>
<li>The HTML editor is now shown inline, and supports syntax highlighting,
and showing opening/closing tags.</li>
<li>Warn user when they attempt to use cloze markers inappropriately
(thanks to Rumo).</li>
</ul>
<p>State handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make changes, the user interface should update more consistently now.
Adding a new tag to a note will update the sidebar in the Browse screen for
example, and when you review a card that is shown there, the columns will
update.</li>
<li>The Browse screen no longer refreshes a search automatically. When you make a
change, the column text may update, but the number of rows will not change.
Deleted cards show &quot;(deleted)&quot; until you search again.</li>
<li>The main window no longer shows a &quot;waiting for editing to finish&quot; screen. When
you make changes such as editing a note, the main window will dim, and will
automatically refresh when you return to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deck options screen has been reimplemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Re)learning steps are now shown with units, eg 10m or 4d.</li>
<li>Deck options are now shown on one scrollable page.</li>
<li>Extra help is available for most options.</li>
<li>It is easy to see at a glance which options have been changed from the
default, and individual options can be reverted to the default setting.</li>
<li>Warnings will be shown for some common issues (eg, review limit too low
compared to new cards).</li>
<li>Some of the more advanced options have been moved to a separate &quot;Advanced&quot;
section.</li>
<li>The old options can be accessed with a Shift+click, since it will take a while
for add-ons to be updated to support the new screen. A new API is available,
thanks to Henrik.</li>
<li>The deck description is now accessible via a button in the overview screen,
instead of via the deck options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated Change Notetype implementation, that can match fields by name, and
allows you to map a source field to multiple destination fields in order to
clone a field.</li>
<li>Pre-load images on answer side (thanks to Hikaru).</li>
<li>The <code>[...]</code> in cloze deletions is now read as &quot;blank&quot; by TTS (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>The Find&amp;Replace option in the Browse screen can now be used on tags as well.</li>
<li>Added a Card Info option to the review screen.</li>
<li>When opening deck option from the study screen, you'll now be asked which deck
you want if the card is in a subdeck.</li>
<li>You can now choose which add-ons you want to update (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>Support system SSL certs on Linux.</li>
<li>Extra checks are now done when updating a card template, such as detecting when
a cloze notetype is missing a cloze directive, or two templates have identical question sides (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Support Ctrl+Numpad Enter to add cards.</li>
<li>Added night mode styling to 'type in the answer' box, and improve legibility
of comparison.</li>
<li>Sidebar search now scrolls to first match (thanks to Abdo &amp; Rumo).</li>
<li>F3/F4 in card layout screen go to next/previous template (thanks to Evandro).</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom study now limits the tag selection to 100 tags or fewer, to prevent errors caused by exceeding database limits.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue compiling on recent Python 3.9 installs.</li>
<li>Fixed audio getting stuck when pausing near end (thanks to kelciour).</li>
<li>Fixed building on linux-arm64 (thanks to qubist-pixel-ux).</li>
<li>Fixed Card Info screen not ignoring manual rescheduling when calculating the average time.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when pressing the copy shortcut with no active selection.</li>
<li>Fixed current review card sometimes changing when making edits.</li>

<h2 id="changes-in-2141"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2141">Changes in 2.1.41</a></h2>
<p>Released 2021-03-07, build 312fa278.</p>
<p>Browser improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags now show in a tree (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Added a search bar to the sidebar (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>New context menu actions to rename or remove tags and their children, rename
decks, manage notetypes, and rename/remove saved searches (thanks to Abdo
and BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>The preview button in the browse screen has moved into the editing area (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>With the improved sidebar, a number of options have been removed from the Filter button.</li>
<li>The remaining items in the Filter button have been moved into the sidebar, and
the Filter button removed.</li>
<li>Tags and decks can now be dragged and dropped in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Each section can now be expanded/collapsed.</li>
<li>&quot;Due&quot; now shows only cards due that day.</li>
<li>Added &quot;Overdue&quot; item.</li>
<li>Click on Decks to show whole collection.</li>
<li>Click on Flags to show any flag.</li>
<li>Click on Tags to show all non-empty tags.</li>
<li>Added &quot;Untagged&quot; under Tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Editing improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags will now be used by default instead of the previous <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
tags, which solves some issues with multiple lines in cloze deletions and
MathJax (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>The tags field in the editor now autocompletes from anywhere in a tag name,
not only the start.</li>
<li>Invalid field content can no longer spill out into the editing area (thanks to Henrik).</li>
</ul>
<p>Search improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searches are now rewritten into a canonical format (eg <code>one two</code> becomes
<code>&quot;one&quot; AND &quot;two&quot;</code>) (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Search error messages are now much more specific (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>is:learn, is:due and prop:due now handle more cases, such as suspended cards
(thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Added prop:pos search to search for new card position (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Added a shortcut to replace part of a search with a different search
(eg changing the selected deck) (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Support resched:x for searching for cards that were manually rescheduled
in x days (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Support prop:rated/resched to search for rated/rescheduled cards over
specific time periods (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Filtered decks can now be created from a browser search, and vice versa (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Filtered deck screen now has a link to show cards not matched by search (thanks to Rumo, Abdo).</li>
<li>Better ergonomics for developers (thanks to Rumo).</li>
</ul>
<p>Graph improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of the graphs can now be clicked on to search for the cards
displayed by the graph (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>The starting day of week can now be altered in the Calendar graph (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>The Card Counts graph now supports toggling separate suspended/buried counts (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>The intervals and ease graphs now covers more cases, such as suspended cards
(thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Place less emphasis on outliers in the Calendar graph (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Ignore manually scheduled cards in hour graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduler improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The V2 scheduler no longer applies parent review limits to child decks.
Previously the limits were inconsistently applied, which could lead to the
deck list not reflecting the actual number of cards you'd receive when you
clicked on a deck. AnkiMobile and AnkiWeb have been updated to match this
behaviour, and AnkiDroid will also be updated soon. Using 2.1.41 in
conjunction with older clients will not cause any problems when syncing, but
you may find the deck list/review counts do not match.</li>
<li>The V1-&gt;V2 upgrade process no longer resets cards that are in learning, or
removes cards from filtered decks.</li>
<li>Users on the old scheduler will now see a message at the top of the deck
list prompting them to update to the Anki 2.1 scheduler.</li>
<li>There is no option to downgrade to the V1 scheduler anymore, though you can
still do so by downgrading to an older Anki version first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reworked the Reschedule tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split into separate &quot;Forget&quot; and &quot;Set Due Date&quot; actions</li>
<li>&quot;Set Due Date&quot; defaults to not adjusting the card interval.</li>
<li>Changed the &quot;Delete Tags&quot; shortcut; Ctrl+Shift+D now changes the due date.</li>
<li>Added the action to the review screen as well.</li>
<li>Input now remembered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic sync server is now built into Anki. It does not yet support
media. Docs are in the docs/ folder of the source tree.</li>
<li>The title bar on Macs will now turn dark when night mode is activated.</li>
<li>Deck descriptions of the congratulations screen can be enabled by turning markdown
on in the deck options, but only 2.1.41+ will be able to render the markdown.</li>
<li>Add opus to media list in editor.</li>
<li>Edit/More buttons auto-hide when window is small (thanks to Henrik).</li>
<li>Support Alt+number to switch between clozes in the card layout screen (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Use monospace font in HTML editor.</li>
<li>Improve error message when trying to nest under a filtered deck (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Reposition dialog's &quot;shift cards&quot; option now defaults to off.</li>
<li>Other fixes and improvements thanks to Henrik, Rumo, Abdo, Arthur, Maksim, Guillem,
stayingpeachy, Daniel, khonkhortisan and Kerrick.</li>

<p>Released 2020-12-09, build c505894b.</p>
<p>Notable changes:</p>

a macOS version older than 10.13, Anki 2.1.35 is the last release you will be able
to update to.</li>
<li>MathJax has been updated to version 3, thanks to Henrik. It should render faster
than before. If you were customizing the MathJax configuration using Javascript,
you will need to
<a href="https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/809#issuecomment-721438738">use a new method</a>.</li>
<li>A separate mpv process is now used to play videos on Windows, which should
solve issues with playing getting stuck, thanks to Kelciour.</li>

<li>Other minor fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki is now built using Bazel. This leads to more reliable builds, and reduces
the number of dependencies you need to manually install. Please see docs/ for
updated build instructions, and report any issues you encounter on the user
forums.</li>
<li>The minimum Python version has been updated to 3.8.</li>
<li>The wheels available on PyPI support both Python 3.8 and 3.9.</li>
<li>All translations have been migrated to <a href="https://translating.ankiweb.net/anki/developers.html">Fluent</a>.</li>
<li>Normal and night mode theming now uses CSS variables, making it easier to override in add-ons.</li>

reposition/reset have been reworked. If you were modifying them in an add-on, your add-on
may need updating. For the congratulations screen, see the new webview_did_inject_style_into_page
hook</li>

<h2 id="changes-in-2135"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2135">Changes in 2.1.35</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-10-02, build 84dcaa86.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.29+ that caused excessive memory and CPU usage
on long-running operations that show a progress bar, such as importing.</li>
<li>Roll back Mac and Windows builds to Qt 5.14 again,
as there are still issues with 5.15.</li>

<h2 id="changes-in-2134"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2134">Changes in 2.1.34</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-09-24, build 8af8f565.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to
an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck
configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those
deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. Users who updated from
an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not be
affected. If you have deliberately set an initial ease of 130%, please change
it to 131% or greater prior to upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings
alone. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.</li>
<li>Update the standard builds to the latest GUI toolkit version.
Please report any improvements or regressions you notice.</li>
<li>Dropped audio plays automatically again (thanks to abdo).</li>
<li>Revert to older sound playing behaviour to work around issues
(thanks to kelciour).</li>

<h2 id="changes-in-2128"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2128">Changes in 2.1.28</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-07-20, build 7d8818f8.</p>
<p>2.1.28 is a big update with changes in a number of areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A reworked graphs screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewritten with new graphing tools for more interactivity.</li>
<li>Graphs can now be displayed for arbitrary searches.</li>
<li>Added a calendar/heatmap view.</li>
<li>If you need them for add-ons, the old graphs are currently still
accessible with a shift+click on the Stats button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reworked syncing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal syncs and media syncs can operate in parallel, speeding up startup and shutdown.</li>
<li>Normal syncs no longer need to close open windows like the Browse screen, or close &amp; re-open
the collection.</li>
<li>Full syncs now show a progress bar.</li>
<li>Full syncs can now be cancelled, and both normal and full syncs cancel more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card generation changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Card generation now supports negated conditionals, and a mix of required
and optional fields.</li>
<li>When adding/importing, if a normal note doesn't generate any cards, Anki
will now add a blank card 1 instead of refusing to add the note.</li>
<li>Please bear in mind that if you take advantage of these features, older Anki
clients may report the cards are blank, or try to clean them up when you
use the Empty Cards feature.</li>
<li>Cloze numbers over 499 are no longer supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card template screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes are now accumulated, and can be saved or discarded when you close the screen.</li>
<li>The front, back, and styling are no longer shown at the same time. You can switch between them with ctrl+1/2/3 or cmd+1/2/3.</li>
<li>Added a search bar to search for text in the template or styling.</li>
<li>Added a dropdown to change the previewed cloze number.</li>
<li>Added a checkbox to toggle the filling of empty fields for preview.</li>
<li>You can now delete a card template even if some notes are only using that
template - they will be given a blank card 1 instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheduling:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deck list no longer caps counts to 1000.</li>
<li>The overview and study screen no longer cap counts to 1000.</li>
<li>The deck list will no longer show a parent count higher than the limit
set on the parent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empty cards screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes will not be deleted by default.</li>
<li>Empty cards are grouped by note type.</li>
<li>Empty cards can be clicked on to reveal them in the browse screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes with the wrong field count are now recovered instead of being deleted.</li>
<li>Notes with missing note types are now recovered instead of being deleted.</li>
<li>Notes with missing cards are now recovered instead of being deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unicode normalization:</p>
<p>If you are studying rare CJK characters and wish to prevent them from being converted into
modern equivalents, the following in the debug console will stop Anki from normalizing note text.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">mw.col.conf[&quot;normalize_note_text&quot;] = False
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard Windows build has troubles with the AltGr key. This is fixed
in the 2.1.29 beta, or <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/altgr-shortcuts/67">a workaround is available</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard Mac build currently does not support native dark mode. If you
previously enabled it from the terminal, please either try the 2.1.29 beta, or
undo the change with the following terminal command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool yes
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-2124"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2124">Changes in 2.1.24</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-04-28, build 359b9f5c.</p>
<p>Searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>w:something</code> to search on word boundaries, eg:
<ul>
<li><code>w:dog</code><br />
search for &quot;dog&quot; on a word boundary - will match &quot;dog&quot;, but not &quot;doggy&quot;
or &quot;underdog&quot;.</li>
<li><code>w:dog*</code><br />
will match &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;doggy&quot;, but not &quot;underdog&quot;.</li>
<li><code>w:*dog</code><br />
will match &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;underdog&quot;, but not &quot;doggy&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now use <code>re:something</code> to search via regular expression, eg:
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;re:(some|another).*thing&quot;</code><br />
find notes that have &quot;some&quot; or &quot;another&quot; on them, followed by 0 or more characters, and then &quot;thing&quot;</li>
<li><code>re:\d{3}</code><br />
find notes that have 3 digits in a row</li>
<li>When searching by regex, unicode case folding is used, so searching for <code>re:Ã¼ber</code> will
show a card that has &quot;Ãœber&quot; on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>nc:something</code> (short for &quot;no combining (characters)&quot;) can be used to search while
ignoring accents, eg <code>nc:uber</code> will match both &quot;Ã¼ber&quot; and &quot;Ãœber&quot;. This behaves the same way as the &quot;Ignore Accents&quot; add-on, but is about 16x faster.</li>
<li>You can now sort on the deck, card template, note type and tags columns.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when limiting the search to a field, eg <code>field*:something</code>.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when searching for a card template or note type by name.</li>
<li><code>rated:x</code> searches are now capped to a year instead of a month.</li>
<li>You can now escaped double-quotes in a search - eg <code>&quot;foo\&quot;bar&quot;</code></li>
<li>Single-quote searches are no longer supported.</li>
<li>Because the searching code has been rewritten, add-ons that modify the search
code will need to be updated to support 2.1.24. It is no longer possible to
override the Finder class - add-ons will need to use the new hooks in the
browser screen to either rewrite the search text, or perform their own lookups
instead. The Advanced Browser add-on has already been updated, and can be used
as an example of how to accomplish things in 2.1.24.</li>
<li>Non-wildcard searches now do full unicode case folding (eg 'tag:masse' matches 'MaÃŸe').</li>
<li>Wildcard searches do simple unicode case folding.</li>
<li>The tag list in the Browse screen now uses unicode case folding.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS dark mode handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anki now solely relies on the night mode setting in the preferences to decide
whether to show in light or dark mode. Some users wanted to run Anki in light
mode while keeping the rest of their system dark, and there were various
display problems when dark mode was changed after Anki started that couldn't
be easily worked around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who only use dark mode, and preferred the native look of widgets in dark
mode, can achieve the previous appearance by running the following command in
the terminal:</p>
<p>:warning: This will only work if your system is permanently in dark mode!
If you switch between dark and light mode, the interface will render incorrectly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool no
</code></pre>
<p>And the following in the debug console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">mw.pm.meta[&quot;dark_mode_widgets&quot;] = True
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Database changes (mainly of interest to add-on developers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki now uses Rust's sqlite libraries instead of Python's.</li>
<li>The 'db' object on the collection retains most of the same API as before, minimizing the amount of immediate code changes that are required.</li>
<li>Custom sql functions are no longer supported, and named DB arguments (eg &quot;where id = :id&quot;) are deprecated.</li>
<li>The old database code remains in db.py, and add-ons can continue to use it for accessing
their own databases.</li>
<li>The database is now behind a mutex, and can be safely accessed from a background thread.</li>
<li>Various screens like the database check have been updated to run on a background thread,
so they no longer lock up the UI while they're running.</li>
<li>The database progress handler has been removed. Anki previous had sqlite call back into
Python periodically during long-running DB operations so it could drain the UI queue,
but this would vary in choppyness depending on the type of DB operation being performed,
and it was the cause of some crashes in the past. Add-ons that perform long-running operations
should instead use mw.taskman.run_in_background() or their own threading solution moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tweak which should fix some broken add-ons from preventing the collection from being loaded.</li>
<li>Add socks support to media sync.</li>
<li>Allow dragging fields to change their position (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>Allow selecting add-on config help text (thanks to ijgnd).</li>
<li>Allow the type answer arrow to be styled (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Anki will now wait for a media sync to complete or be aborted before closing the collection.</li>
<li>Build improvements (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Changed the way cloze deletions in RTL fields are handled, which should address some corner cases.</li>
<li>Clean up the previewing code (thanks to Arthur). Add-ons that modify the preview screen will need updating.</li>
<li>Don't force a full sync when DB check finds cards with a high due number.</li>
<li>Don't show a popup when a network error occurs while syncing media.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where decks could be sorted incorrectly (thanks to Arthur).</li>
<li>Fixed a useless log file being created when exporting.</li>
<li>Fixed add-ons with multiple branches not updating properly.</li>
<li>Fixed an error that could occur when performing an operation in the browse screen then immediately closing it.</li>
<li>Fixed Anki closing after a full sync on collection load.</li>
<li>Fixed current card sometimes not being centered when searching.</li>
<li>Fixed deck_browser_did_render hook.</li>
<li>Fixed editor buttons not being highlighted (thanks to Simone).</li>
<li>Fixed interface getting stuck when a corrupt collection was encountered.</li>
<li>Fixed media sync waiting forever when connection dropped.</li>
<li>Fixed progress dialogs failing to appear in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Fixed tag searches in custom study (thanks to zjosua).</li>
<li>Fixed the collection_did_load add-on hook.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong language shown in the preferences screen for some languages.</li>
<li>GitHub now checks Windows and Mac builds as well (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Handle renamed cloze fields when previewing (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>Ignore .DS_Store files in the media trash folder.</li>
<li>Improved invalid HTML/JS error messages (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Improved the handling of deck deletions (thanks to Arthur).</li>
<li>Improvements to debug console (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>Left-align tags in the browser.</li>
<li>Media syncs no longer take time to abort.</li>
<li>More hooks (thanks to Arthur).</li>
<li>Moved the scheduling options in the preferences to a separate tab, so options fit on the screen even on devices with small screens.</li>
<li>Prepare for uploading releases to PyPI (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>The media check will now fix file references in fields that broke because a filename was shortened as part of a sync.</li>
<li>Updated config handling. While there should be no immediate breakages, if you're an add-on author and
store lists or dicts in Anki's config, please see 676f4e74a.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-2123"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2123">Changes in 2.1.23</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-03-19, build de9543ff.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-2122"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2122">Changes in 2.1.22</a></h2>
<p>Released 2020-03-18, build 0ecc189a.</p>
<p>Media syncing improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media syncing now happens in the background, so you can continue using
Anki while the media sync completes.</li>
<li>Aside from syncing at open and close, Anki will sync any media changes
every 15-20 minutes.</li>
<li>You can click on the sync button while the spinner is active to monitor
progress.</li>

instead of causing syncing errors.</li>
<li>Anki should no longer sometimes forget to download files when a media
sync fails due to network errors.</li>
<li>When media files are added within Anki, Anki now marks them
in the database immediately, which can make things faster for people with
slower disks if they are not modifying the media folder externally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Media check improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Check Media function now shows progress, and can be interrupted.</li>
<li>There is now a separate button to generate missing LaTeX.</li>
<li>If LaTeX fails to build, the problem card will be revealed in the browse
screen.</li>
<li>When Anki finds files that are too long or would cause errors on some
operating systems, it will automatically rename them and update your notes
to point to the new filename.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both media sync and the media check now place deleted files in a media.trash
folder inside your profile, instead of placing the files in the system trash.
You can use the Check Media function to either empty the trash, or restore
the deleted files back to your media folder.</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now export .apkg files with the V2 scheduler enabled.</li>

<h2 id="changes-in-216"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-216">Changes in 2.1.6</a></h2>
<p>Released 2018-12-10.</p>
<p>Downloads are now split into a standard and alternate version.</p>
<p><strong>The standard version</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is built with the latest toolkit, which fixes various issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes the undo shortcut back to Ctrl+Z or Command+Z like Anki 2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a separate anki-console.exe executable in the Windows build
that may be useful for add-on authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes support for the fcitx input method and a gtk2 theme in the
Linux build.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can switch between the standard and alternate 2.1.6 without
problems. If you move back to a previous Anki 2.1 release, your sync
login details and window positions will be lost, and will need to be set
again.</p>
<p><strong>The standard version has updated requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Windows build only supports 64 bit Windows 7 or later, and will
not run on a 32 bit install.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mac build requires macOS 10.12 or later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Linux build requires a Linux distribution from approximately
2016 or later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternate version is similar to previous Anki 2.1 releases, and is
built with an older toolkit. It will run on some older systems that the
standard version will not, but as it is not as up to date, it may be
missing bugfixes and security improvements that the standard version
includes.</p>
<p><strong>The alternate version will run on</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit installs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mac 10.10 or later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Linux distro from around 2014 or later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition to the toolkit upgrade, there have been some changes in
Anki itself</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improvements to the Browse screen and flagging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search text is normalized, which fixes problems searching for
unicode characters with multiple possible encodings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The selection is now partially transparent, allowing you to see
the underyling colours of the rows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The screen doesnâ€™t scroll when performing actions that donâ€™t
change the selection count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flags now toggle on and off, and the separate clear flag action
has been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second flag is now orange instead of purple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find&amp;replace now only shows fields relevant to the notes youâ€™ve
selected, and is case insensitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix card list not updating when editing HTML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importing apkgs is now more verbose about how notes have been
handled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent errors caused by the user adding a field reference to itself
on a field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better handle issues with the deck list, such as decks that are
missing a parent deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki should now be able to function even if a system proxy is
configured for localhost connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix font size being copied when pasting between Anki fields with
bold text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting a link with shift held down now creates a clickable link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with the bulk remove tags option where tags with
similar names could be removed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an error that occurred with very long filenames on Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue running latex commands on some Linux installs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Browse screenâ€™s sidebar now defaults to on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a race condition that could cause two copies of Anki to open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When adding media to cards, Anki now will automatically rename the
filenames if theyâ€™re too long.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Anki 2.1 uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki
2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itâ€™s built with recent support libraries (Python 3.6, Qt 5.9/5.12),
bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution
displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux
distro from around 2014+.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="add-ons"><a class="header" href="#add-ons">Add-ons</a></h2>
<p>Add-ons need to be updated to work with Anki 2.1. <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1">Some
add-ons</a> have already been
updated; others have not been ported yet.</p>
<p>When you install 2.1, it will create a separate folder for add-ons, and
not import any existing ones you have installed.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re an add-on author, you can read more about the required changes
on <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html">https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons.html</a></p>
<h2 id="other-changes"><a class="header" href="#other-changes">Other changes</a></h2>
<p>Anki 2.1 brings numerous bugfixes, and some quality of life
improvements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Built in MathJax support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &quot;restore backup&quot; option in the profiles screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SVG rendering support for LaTeX</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved add-on configuration, management and updating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night mode for reviewing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved pasting, with less unnecessary formatting included, and
better handling of media links. You can hold the shift key when
pasting to allow more formatting to be included.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Browse screen has been simplified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Various shortcuts that were previously in the sidebar are now
available via the Filter button. If you find yourself frequently
accessing certain items, you can save the search to have them appear
in the side bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top bar with common shortcuts has been removed. You can access
all actions quickly by right clicking or ctrl+clicking in the card
list instead, and there is an add-on available for adding back the
top bar if you still prefer it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

documented <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/beta.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-acceleration-and-startup-issues-on-windowslinux"><a class="header" href="#hardware-acceleration-and-startup-issues-on-windowslinux">Hardware acceleration and startup issues on Windows/Linux</a></h2>
<p>Hardware acceleration defaults to off on Windows and Linux. Enabling it
in the preferences screen and restarting Anki may make Ankiâ€™s interface
more responsive, but some users may experience missing menubars, blank
windows or crashes when it is enabled.</p>
<p>On Windows if youâ€™re unable to get to Ankiâ€™s preferences screen and
restarting Anki a few times does not help, you may need to manually
adjust the graphics driver. You can do this by starting cmd.exe and
typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>echo auto &gt; %APPDATA%\Anki2\gldriver
</code></pre>
<p>There are three settings you can try: 'auto', 'angle', and 'software'.
If you have problems both when hardware acceleration is turned on and
turned off in the preferences, itâ€™s worth giving 'angle' a go.</p>
<p>On Linux, you can write either 'auto' or 'software' into
~/.local/share/Anki2/gldriver to adjust the driver. Please note that if
youâ€™re using nouveau, it is known to be buggy and it only supports
software mode.</p>
<h2 id="interface-speed"><a class="header" href="#interface-speed">Interface speed</a></h2>
<p>Even if you enable hardware acceleration as mentioned above, you may
find Anki takes longer to start and show new windows - especially if
your computer is not the fastest. This is caused by the use of a newer
web toolkit, which brings new features and security improvements, but is
unfortunately more resource intensive. The web toolkit older Anki
versions use has been abandoned at this point, so it is no longer an
option for future releases.</p>
<h2 id="blank-screens-and-egpus-on-macs"><a class="header" href="#blank-screens-and-egpus-on-macs">Blank screens and eGPUs on Macs</a></h2>
<p>If you experience blank screens when using an external graphics card on
a Mac, You can either use the -alternate version from the download site,
or ctrl+click on the Anki app, click &quot;Get Info&quot;, and enable the &quot;prefer
eGPU&quot; option.</p>
<p>When switching between monitors of different resolutions, you may
also run into problems that can be <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/mac-known-issues-wording-suggestion/7331">worked around</a>.</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts"><a class="header" href="#shortcuts">Shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>The undo shortcut is different in the alternate version due to an issue
with the toolkit. You can discover the alternate shortcut by looking at
the Edit menu of the main screen.</p>
<p>On macOS, the alternate build does not support some shortcuts like
cmd+left/right when editing cards. Fn+left/right does work instead. You
can also use a third party tool like BetterTouchTool or Karabiner to
intercept the cmd+left/right keystroke when you type it into Anki, and
have it automatically be rewritten to use the function key instead.</p>
<h2 id="copy--paste-problems-on-windows"><a class="header" href="#copy--paste-problems-on-windows">Copy &amp; paste problems on Windows</a></h2>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with copying and pasting on Windows,
please check if you are running other programs on your computer that
monitor the clipboard, such as dictionary programs, clipboard managers
or clipping tools. The toolkit Anki uses can have trouble when such
programs are running.</p>
<h2 id="fcitx-on-linux"><a class="header" href="#fcitx-on-linux">Fcitx on Linux</a></h2>
<p>The standard Anki build includes fcitx support, but it may not work on
all distributions. If you are unable to use fcitx, you may want to run
Anki from source, or switch to a different input method.</p>
<h2 id="text-size"><a class="header" href="#text-size">Text size</a></h2>
<p>If you find the text is the wrong size, there are two environmental
variables you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ANKI_NOHIGHDPI=1 will turn off some of Qtâ€™s high dpi support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANKI_WEBSCALE=1 will alter the scale of Ankiâ€™s web views (like the
deck list, study screen, etc), while leaving interface elements like
the menu bar alone. Replace 1 with the desired scale, such as 1.5 or
0.75.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows you can add these to a batch file to make it easier to start
Anki. For example, create a file called startanki.bat on your desktop
with the following text:</p>
<pre><code>set ANKI_WEBSCALE=0.75
start &quot;Anki&quot; &quot;C:\Program Files\Anki\anki&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>After saving, you can double click on the file to start Anki with that
setting.</p>
<h2 id="ssl-errors"><a class="header" href="#ssl-errors">SSL errors</a></h2>
<p>The following applies to Anki versions before 2.1.28. Newer versions
use the system keychain, and no longer need the workaround below.</p>
<p>Some work and school networks intercept your internet traffic, and this
can cause errors when syncing and downloading add-ons. You can prevent
the errors from occurring by setting the environmental variable
&quot;ANKI_NOVERIFYSSL&quot; to &quot;1&quot;.</p>
<p>When you enable this option, you are telling Anki not to verify that it
is actually talking with AnkiWeb. This means that not only your work or
school, but also a bad actor on the local network may be able to
intercept your syncing traffic.</p>
<p>On Windows, you can create a .bat file as described in the Text size
section above.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can open Terminal.app, then start Anki with the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>ANKI_NOVERIFYSSL=1 open /Applications/Anki.app
</code></pre>
<p>On Linux, use the following in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>ANKI_NOVERIFYSSL=1 anki
</code></pre>
<p>Once youâ€™ve started Anki with SSL disabled, you can download the
following add-on to make the change permanent:</p>
